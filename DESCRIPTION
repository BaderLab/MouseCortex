Abstract: Adult neural stem cells (NSCs) derive from embryonic precursors, but little 
    is known about how or when this occurs. We have addressed this issue using single-cell 
    RNA sequencing at multiple developmental time points to analyze the embryonic murine 
    cortex, one source of adult forebrain NSCs. We computationally identify all major 
    cortical cell types, including the embryonic radial precursors (RPs) that generate 
    adult NSCs. We define the initial emergence of RPs from neuroepithelial stem cells at 
    E11.5. We show that, by E13.5, RPs express a transcriptional identity that is 
    maintained and reinforced throughout their transition to a non-proliferative state 
    between E15.5 and E17.5. These slowly proliferating late embryonic RPs share a core 
    transcriptional phenotype with quiescent adult forebrain NSCs. Together, these 
    findings support a model wherein cortical RPs maintain a core transcriptional identity 
    from embryogenesis through to adulthood and wherein the transition to a quiescent 
    adult NSC occurs during late neurogenesis.
