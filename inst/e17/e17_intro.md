### Abstract
Adult neural stem cells (NSCs) derive from embryonic precursors, but little 
is known about how or when this occurs. We have addressed this issue using single-cell 
RNA sequencing at multiple developmental time points to analyze the embryonic murine 
cortex, one source of adult forebrain NSCs. We computationally identify all major 
cortical cell types, including the embryonic radial precursors (RPs) that generate 
adult NSCs. We define the initial emergence of RPs from neuroepithelial stem cells at 
E11.5. We show that, by E13.5, RPs express a transcriptional identity that is 
maintained and reinforced throughout their transition to a non-proliferative state 
between E15.5 and E17.5. These slowly proliferating late embryonic RPs share a core 
transcriptional phenotype with quiescent adult forebrain NSCs. Together, these 
findings support a model wherein cortical RPs maintain a core transcriptional identity 
from embryogenesis through to adulthood and wherein the transition to a quiescent 
adult NSC occurs during late neurogenesis.  

**These are embryonic day 17.5 cortically-derived cells.**
